# Would You Rather

Built a **Would You Rather** application where users are given questions and must choose one of them. built this dynamic application from scratch while combining the state management features of `Redux` and component model of `React`. When complete, being able to create your own sets of questions, choose between them, and keep track of question popularity.

## To run the game:

```bash
  yarn

  yarn start
```

### ---> **Note:**

when you visit the game, we need to sign in by choosing a character, then the app direct you to Home page but unfortunately we gonna see this message:
**No Match 404 Error Nothing to see here. Please use the menu to try again.**, this happend because a deployment issue with `GitHub Pages` and the routing to my old personal website.
**_To Fix and remove this message you need to click on `Home` in the `Nav` inside the game_**
